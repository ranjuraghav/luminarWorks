        <h2>AUTHOR:Dante Alighieri</h2>
        <p>The Divine Comedy (Italian: Divina Commedia [diˈviːna komˈmɛːdja]) is a long Italian narrative poem by Dante
            Alighieri, begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the
            pre-eminent work in Italian literature[1] and one of the greatest works of world literature.[2] The poem's
            imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it had developed in the
            Western Church by the 14th century.</p>

            Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879.[3</p>
